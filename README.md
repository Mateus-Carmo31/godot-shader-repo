# godot-shader-repo
### A godot project with documented shaders for learning.

I decided to start a compilation of different shaders for the Godot Engine, both as a way for me and others to share shader ideas,
but also as a way for newbies to learn how to write their own. The shaders here are all documented to the best of our ability, so
feel free to use them in your projects or for learning how the intricacies of the Godot Shading Language work.

In case of any explanation that is wrong/misconstrued, please create a new issue so I can check it out.
